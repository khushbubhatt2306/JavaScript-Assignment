Question 1: What are JavaScript events? Explain the role of event listeners. 
=> JavaScript events are actions or occurrences, like a button click, a mouse hover, or a key press, that happen in the browser. They allow developers to make web pages interactive by responding to these actions.
- Role of Event Listeners
Event listeners are functions that wait for specific events to happen on an element and then execute a defined task. They help you handle user interactions.

Question 2: How does the addEventListener() method work in JavaScript? Provide an example.
=> The addEventListener() method is used to attach an event listener to an HTML element. This method listens for a specified event (like click, mouseover, or keydown) and executes a function when the event occurs.
The addEventListener() method lets you attach a function to an HTML element that will run when a specific event happens, like a click or a key press.
- Example
// Select a button
const button = document.querySelector("button");

// Add a click event listener
button.addEventListener("click", () => {
    alert("Button clicked!");
});
