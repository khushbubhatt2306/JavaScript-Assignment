Question 1: What are the different types of operators in JavaScript? Explain with examples. • Arithmetic operators • Assignment operators • Comparison operators • Logical operators
=> Types of operators :- 1) Assignment operators
			 -> var x = 5
			    console.log(x)
			 2) Arithmetic operators
			 -> var a=10, b=20
			    console.log("sum of value:- ",a+b)
			    console.log("sum of value:- ",a-b)
			    console.log("sum of value:- ",a%b)
			 3) Conditional/Comparison operators
			 -> let a=30, b=40
			    let ab = (a>b)
			    console.log(ab) 
			 4) Combination/Logical/rational operators
			 -> (&& , ! , ||)
	                    let a = 10, b= 20
			    let ab = (a>=10 && b<=20)			    
			    let ab = (a>=10 || b<=20)
			    let ab = !true			    
			 5) ternari operators
			 -> let a=30, b=40
			    let ab = (a>b) ? a:b
			    console.log(ab)
			 6) increment/decrement operators
			 -> let a = 10
			    console.log(a++)
			    console.log(--a)

Question 2: What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript? 
=> == check only value
   === check both value and type
